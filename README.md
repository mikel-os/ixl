# Ixl

A nine-like file system for unix.

No, not that meaning of "file system". The other one.

Ixl (whose name comes from "nine-layer") provides in conjunction with plan9port
a clonic file system based on the Plan 9's one, completely at user space level,
and without the hassle of modifying different kernels
(when such thing is even possible).

This software is intended to be an attempt before creating a full blown
operating system with research and educational purposes.
